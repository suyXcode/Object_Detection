🖼️ Object Detection Project

This project implements an Object Detection system using deep learning techniques. The model can detect and classify objects in images or video streams, making it useful for real-world applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and smart systems.

📌 Features

Detects multiple objects in images and videos.

Supports real-time detection using a webcam or live feed.

Uses pre-trained models (e.g., YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN).

Visualizes bounding boxes and class labels on detected objects.

Easy to extend with custom datasets.
